Description:
    Stubs out a new chanko file with controller and view callbacks,
    a stylesheet, spec files and default logo image.

    This will generate the chanko class template in app/chankos/,
    a view stub in /app/chankos/#{chanko_name}/views/ ,
    a stylesheet in /app/chankos/#{chanko_name}/stylesheets/ ,
    spec stubs in /app/chankos/#{chanko_name}/specs/ ,
    and the blank logo.png in /app/chankos/#{chanko_name}/images/
    along with a symlink in public/images/chankos/#{chanko_name}

    You will need to add the invoke(:your_chanko, :callback_name) code in the appropriate places.

Example:
    rails generate chanko sample

    This will create:
        app/chankos/sample.rb
        app/chankos/sample/views/show.html.haml
        app/chankos/sample/stylesheets/sample.scss
        app/chankos/sample/images/logo.png
        app/chankos/sample/specs/controllers/sample_controller_spec.rb
        app/chankos/sample/specs/models/sample_model_spec.rb
        app/chankos/sample/specs/helper/sample_helper_spec.rb
        public/images/chankos/sample -> ../../../app/chankos/sample/images
